## Getting started
  1. Download a [release](https://github.com/kbilsted/NotepadPlusPlusPluginPack.Net/releases/) 
  2. Place the visual studio project template (the `NppPlugin.zip`) in the visual studio path (typically `"My Documents\Visual Studio 2015\Templates\ProjectTemplates\Visual C#\"`)
  3. Ensure you have installed **Visual C++** from the visual studio installer otherwise your project wont build<br>
  ![install CPP](/documentation/installcpp.png)
  4. Create a new project inside Visual studio using `file -> new -> project -> visual C# -> Notepad++ project`
  5. Build (building will copy the dll to the `Notepad++/plugins` folder)
  6. Start Notepad++ and activate your plugin from the plugins menu


## Upgrading to a newer version
  * Upgrading the pluging package
    *  simply by replacing the `NppPlugin.zip` from your visual studio (typically `"My Documents\Visual Studio 2015\Templates\ProjectTemplates\Visual C#\"`) with a newer version
  * Upgrading plugings using the plugin pack. 
    * Delete the folder `PluginInfrastructure` and copy over that folder from a newer version of `NppPlugin.zip`

## How to start coding plugins

First read the the demo-plugin code. It is actively being maintaned - see https://github.com/kbilsted/NotepadPlusPlusPluginPack.Net/tree/master/Demo%20Plugin it is a spin-off of Don Ho's
    http://download.tuxfamily.org/nppplugins/NppPluginDemo/NppPluginDemo.zip

#### Overall plugin architecture

Plugins can interact with Notepad++ or the underlying Scintilla engine. The plugin pack provides two classes to make this interaction easier. This is `NotepadPlusPlusGateway` and `ScintillaGateWay` which are thin layers making interaction more pleasant (and testable!). 

If you are interested in low-level access you can use the `Win32` api also included in the plugin pack. 

The architecture of the plugin is.


                   +-----------+ +-----------+
                   | Scintilla | | Notepad++ |
                   +-----------+ +-----------+
                        ^             ^
                        |             |
               +--------+--------+----+------------+                   
               |                 |                 |
     +------------------+ +----------------+ +-----------+ 
     | ScintillaGateway | | NotepadGateway | | Win32     |
     +------------------+ +----------------+ +-----------+ 
          ^                     ^                ^        
          |                     |                |        
          +-----------------+---+----------------+                   
                            |              
                       +-----------+ 
                       | Plugin    |
                       +-----------+ 

### How to debug plugins

  * start notepad++
  * in Visualstudio: debug -> attach to process... -> notepad++.exe

you can now set breakpoints and step-execute. (currently not working in v6.9.2 https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/1964) 
  
   * you can make this process easier by setting the "start action" in the project -> properties -> debug to start notepad++.exe - then you can simply build and hit `F5`.


## Versioning
Until we reach v1.0 expect a bit of chaos and breaking changes.

From v1.0 and onwards we will turn over to semantic versioning

## Requirements:
  * works with .NET Runtime 3.5 and above (can easily be reduced to .Net runtime 2.0 if needed)
  * UNICODE plugins only.
